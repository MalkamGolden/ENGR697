  - The "Calibration" Folder contains the basic calibration software for the Server lift prototype
  
      - Calibration.ino is used to calibrate the lift to the lowest position before moving the platform to any 
        specified positions. 
        
      - Calibration_W_Demo.ino is used to calibrate the lift and demo the lift incrementing all 48 levels.
    
  - The "Server Lift iOS App" folder contains all the necessary files to open the application in Xcode
