The "Calibration" Folder contains the basic calibration software for the Server lift prototype:

    Calibration.ino is used to calibrate the lift to the lowest position before moving the platform to any 
    specified positions.

    Calibration_W_Demo.ino is used to calibrate the lift and demo the lift incrementing all 48 levels.
